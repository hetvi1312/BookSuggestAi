BookSuggestAI addresses the challenge of finding books that align with individual preferences by
providing tailored recommendations. This system suggests the top five books based on a user’s
unique interests using a hybrid approach that combines collaborative filtering and content-based
filtering techniques. Collaborative filtering analyzes user interactions and preferences to identify
similar users and recommend books they have enjoyed. Meanwhile, content-based filtering
examines book metadata, such as genres, authors, and descriptions, to match books with a user’s
past likes. By integrating these methods, BookSuggestAI offers personalized and accurate book
suggestions, adapting to both new and experienced users. This dynamic approach ensures that
recommendations evolve with changing tastes, enhancing the reading experience and effectively
matching books to diverse preferences.
